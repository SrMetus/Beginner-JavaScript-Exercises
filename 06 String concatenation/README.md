06 String Concatenation
One of JavaScript's strengths is generating HTML code.

Concatenation comes in handy because you can create and add to existing HTML strings. To concatenate strings, we use the + (plus) operator.

📝 Instructions:
Set the values for myVar1and myVar2 so the code prints 'Hello World' to the console.
Example:
let one = 'a';
let two = 'b';
console.log(one+two); //this will print 'ab' on the console.
