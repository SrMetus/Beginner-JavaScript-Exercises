# `05` Constants
Since 2015, JavaScript has allowed the use of constants.

Constants differ from variables because once declared, they cannot have their values changed over time (unlike variables).

To declare a constant, you have to use the reserved word `const` instead of `var`, like this:

```Javascript
const VERSION = '1.2';
```

Constants are extremely useful. As a developer you may want to make sure parts of your data are read-only.
